## Relevant University Coursework

### **Virtual Reality Solar-System Grand Tour** &#124; `2021`

A simulation of the Voyager 2 probe was made using the Unity engine and programmed using C# as part of a two person group project. Newtonian gravitation was numerically modelled to accurately output the correct trajectory and planetary orbits in accordance to the initial conditions provided by the NASA JPL dataset. VR implementation and interactive controls were implemented to create an immersive teaching experience. A scientific paper was made summarising the results. [Project Link](https://github.com/owen97779/Unity-)


### **Experimental Physics** &#124; `2021`

Physics experiments were performed using technical equipment, with scientific analysis including errors and uncertainties. Two main reports were made that communicated the findings.

### **Numerical Modelling** &#124; `2020`

Scientific computation of two real-world problems, the Travelling Salesman and the Tacoma Bridge. These systems were modelled and analysed in the form of a Jupyter notebook.
